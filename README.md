# Module-5-Challenge
This Repo Contanins a notebook which attempts to aid clients with their financial goals. First, by understading whether they have enough savings
in their investments to have an emergency fund. Second by using monte carlo simulations to understand whether they are on track to meeting their
financial retirement goals or whether they need to alter the weights allocated to each investment in their portfolio.

## Packages and Installations

To run this notebook you need to install Alpaca SDK, OS, Pandas, and dotenv.
